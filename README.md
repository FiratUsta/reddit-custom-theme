# Old Reddit Dark

A custom dark theme for Reddit with color customization, made to look modern without losing the charm of the old layout of Reddit. 

This is primarily a theme I made for myself and I'm just sharing it in case anyone happens to find it useful, so it removes some of the features that I don't personally use such as any references to premium features, ads and gold gifting.

This is a WIP but it should be ready for daily use.
